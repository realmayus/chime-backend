# chime-backend
The backend for chime, a discord music bot.


## Firebase Credentials
Because the backend interfaces with a firebase database, you have to provide a service SDK token. Download it from the settings page of your firebase project and put it in the directory `secret/` and name it `firebase_creds.json`.

## Run
To run the server, make sure you have nodeJS installed.
Enter `node app.js` in your terminal to run the server.
